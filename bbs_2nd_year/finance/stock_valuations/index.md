# 🌱 Core Essence of Stock Valuation

## The Basic Idea

-   **👉 A stock** = ownership in a company.
-   **👉 The value of a stock** = what the company can earn in the future, brought back (discounted) to today.

**That’s it.**

## Stocks vs. Bonds

| Asset | Key Characteristic | Valuation Difficulty |
| :---- | :---------------- | :------------------- |
| **Bond** | Fixed, predictable payments | Easier to value      |
| **Stock** | Uncertain, variable future | Harder to value      |

---

## The Core Rule

A stock's value today is the **Present Value of all Future Cash Flows** to shareholders.

-   **If a company pays dividends** → those are the direct cash flows.
-   **If it doesn't pay dividends** → use profits or free cash flow instead.

> **Future is uncertain** → Therefore, valuation always involves making assumptions about:
> - **Growth**: How fast will earnings/cash flows grow?
> - **Risk**: How uncertain are these future earnings? (This determines the discount rate).
> - **Interest Rates**: The time value of money.

## 🍎 Super-Simple Analogy: The Fruit Tree

Imagine you own a fruit tree:

-   Every year, it gives you fruit (this represents **profits** or **dividends**).
-   The value of the tree is **not** based on what it produced last year, but on **all the fruit you will get from it in the future**.
-   This future harvest must be adjusted for:
    - **Time**: Fruit you get next year is worth more than fruit you get in 10 years.
    - **Risk**: What if a drought kills the tree? What if it produces even more?

**This is exactly how a stock is valued.**

-   If people expect the tree to give **more fruit** in the future (higher growth) → the stock price goes **up**.
-   If people expect **less fruit** or think a drought is more likely (higher risk) → the stock price goes **down**.

## ✅ The Core Essence Summarized

> **A stock is worth the present value of its future money-making ability.**

Everything else—P/E ratios, DCF models, valuation multiples—are just different tools and methods for estimating that fundamental value.

# 📝 Helicopter View of Stock Valuation

## 🌱 Core Essence

> **👉 A stock’s value = present value of all future cash flows to shareholders.**  
> Everything else is just a method to estimate those future cash flows.

## 1. Absolute Valuation  
*(Direct fundamentals → company itself)*

- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** → Value = all future free cash flows discounted back to today.
- **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)** → Value = present value of expected dividends.
- **Residual Income Model** → Value = book value + future abnormal profits.

📌 *When to use?* For companies with predictable cash flows or dividends.

---

## 2. Relative Valuation  
*(Compare with peers/market)*

Use multiples/ratios like:

- **P/E** → Price ÷ Earnings
- **P/B** → Price ÷ Book Value
- **EV/EBITDA** → Enterprise Value ÷ Operating Profits

📌 Logic: *“If similar companies trade at X multiple, this one should too.”*  
📌 *When to use?* Quick comparisons, startups, uncertain growth firms.

---

## 3. Asset-Based Valuation  
*(What company owns – what it owes)*

- **Value = Assets – Liabilities** (Net Asset Value).  
- Used for banks, insurance, real estate firms, or liquidation scenarios.

---

## 4. Other/Advanced Approaches

- **Options-based models** (Real Options, Black-Scholes) → for firms with uncertain growth opportunities.
- **Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)** → when a company has many business units (e.g., Amazon cloud + retail).

## 🚁 Helicopter Summary

| Approach          | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Absolute**      | Look inside the company (DCF, DDM, etc.)     |
| **Relative**      | Compare with neighbors (multiples)           |
| **Asset-based**   | What’s left if we sell everything            |

**But…**  
👉 **ALL of them rest on one foundation**:  
A stock is only worth what future cash flows to investors are worth today.

---

### 💡 Mental Shortcut:

- **Bonds** = future fixed payments → easier to value.
- **Stocks** = future uncertain profits → harder to value.
- **Valuation methods** = different lenses to guess those profits.
